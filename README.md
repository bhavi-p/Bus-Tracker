# Bus-Tracker
## Description: 
Using MapBox API, you can view a map of the MIT-Harvard area and clicking "Show Buses" will display live markers indicating the current busses en route in the area.
## How to Run: 
The files can be cloned on local and index.html opened in a web browser. Clicking the "Show Busses" will display the busses.
## Roadmap of future improvements: 
I would like to display more information on the busses displayed when the user hovers their cursor over each marker.
