# Bus-Tracker
## Description: 
Currently this project displays a map of the MIT/Harvard area and the current traffic is displayed. The map has a zoom and rotation control and the Show Busses button displays the current busses en route.
## How to Run: 
The files can be loaded on local and index.html opened in a web browser. Clicking the "Show Busses" will display the busses.
## Roadmap of future improvements: 
I would like to display more information on the busses displayed when the user hovers their cursor over each marker.
